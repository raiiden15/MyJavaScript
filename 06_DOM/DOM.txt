DOM - Document Object Model
HTMLcollections are not arrays, though they can be converted to arrays.
See diagram for reference on excalidraw, we need to see the chart to understand to which particular path we should take for reaching a particular object, therefore that graph or tree is necesarry.



innerText and textContent
text content will show hidden texts also, while innerText only shows what's visible. 
use case dono ka alag h.

innerHTML - pura HTML ka value deta h.

'DOM Learning with Hitesh Sir<span style="display: none;">test text</span>'

document.querySelector('h1') - ye code first occurence of h1 dikhata h
document.querySelectorAll('h1') - ye code saare occurences of h1 dikhata h
